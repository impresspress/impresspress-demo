 *   re-navigated to its own address — which this worker answers with the
 *   shell — and `loader.js` runs its recovery path with the cause on screen.
 * - `false` — a request FROM a page failed (an API call, a form post) after
 *   the runtime had started. The page is left exactly where it is: the
 *   request gets `runtimeStopped`'s 503 and the page shows the cause.
 *   Re-navigating here would replace the page a moment after the cause
 *   reached it, with a clean form that says nothing. When the person reloads

        // pair matches what the runtime already sends on everything it serves
        // in a dev deployment (the security-headers block's
        // `cross_origin_isolation`), so this makes the static files CONSISTENT
        // with the rest of the origin rather than special.
        //
        // `credentialless` rather than `require-corp`: a site an agent built
        // in this sandbox can still show a cross-origin image that carries no
        // `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`, which under `require-corp` it could
        // not.
        //
        // Every bypassed path, not just the toolchain's: the bypass list is
        // the APP's (`--extra-bypass-prefix`), so this worker cannot know

        // a worker script, so widening the rule costs nothing and narrowing it
        // would be a guess.
        //
        // `/sw.js` is kept out. The browser fetches a worker's own script

 * The answer to a request the runtime would have handled, once the runtime

 *
 * A NAVIGATION is answered with the boot shell (`bootShell`), at the address
 * that was asked for, and `loader.js` shows the cause this leaves for it and
 * runs its recovery path.
 *
 * Nothing else is. What reaches `handleFetch` is a request the runtime was
 * going to answer — an API call, a form post — and the static host has
 * nothing of its own to say to one: an empty 405, a 404 page, or `index.html`
 * with a 200 where it falls back for unknown paths. The script that made the
 * request can then report nothing but "something went wrong": the cause is in
 * THIS worker's console, which neither the person nor an agent driving the
 * page can read. So the worker answers it itself, in the shape the runtime
 * gives every error (`wafer_block::http_codec::error_to_http_response`:
 * `error` is the coarse code, `message` the human text, `code` the precise
 * one), with the cause in the message. A page that shows `message` — every
 * auth form does — then shows the cause.
 *
 * The message ends with what a reload of the page does. A reload is a
 * navigation, this worker answers it with the boot shell and leaves the
 * cause, and the shell acts on the cause:
 *
 * - `recoveryErases()` — its recovery erases the app's local data, and the
 *   message says so rather than calling it a restart. "May", because that
 *   recovery runs automatically only once per tab (after that the shell
 *   stops and asks) and only once per death (another tab may already have
 *   done it), and because the browser may have stopped this worker by then:
 *   the reload then starts a new one, which tries the runtime again and may
 *   simply work.
 * - otherwise — the shell replaces this worker with a fresh one and comes
 *   back to the page; nothing is erased. True on any static host, since the
 *   reload never reaches the host.

/**
 * The boot shell's document, as the answer to a navigation to a dead runtime.
 *
 * Fetched from SHELL_URL and not from the address that was asked for. Handing
 * the navigation itself to the static host only works where the host answers
 * unknown paths with the shell; a plain file server answers `/b/…` with its
 * own 404, the shell never loads, and the cause this worker left is never
 * shown. The shell's own address is the one the host must have.
 *
 * A document, not a redirect: the address bar keeps what was asked for, and
 * nothing here can go round — this worker answers, and `loader.js` decides
 * what happens next. The shell loads `/loader.js` and its other scripts by
 * absolute path, and those are on the bypass list, so the fetch handler above
 * leaves them to the network (or to `passthrough`) even now.
 *
 * Rebuilt rather than returned as fetched: a host that answers SHELL_URL by
 * redirecting (to `/index.html`, say) gives a response marked as redirected,
 * which a browser refuses as the answer to a navigation. The body is piped,
 * as in `passthrough`. Whatever the host said is passed on — if it has no
 * shell at SHELL_URL, its answer is the truth about this deployment.
 *
 * With the host's headers and no others, in a dev bundle too: unlike
 * `passthrough`, this adds no cross-origin-isolation pair. The shell is the
 * same document a first visit gets straight from the host, which has no such
 * headers either; it starts no worker and needs no `SharedArrayBuffer`, and
 * a document without an embedder policy may load every script the shell
 * loads. The pages that must be isolated are the runtime's, and they are
 * again once the recovery has a runtime serving them
 * (`dev-stopped-navigation.spec.ts` checks both halves in a browser).
