        // (it needs `SharedArrayBuffer` for the in-browser Rust toolchain),
        // and the toolchain's worker script is one of the files bypassed
        // above — a quarter of a gigabyte of static assets that must not go
        // through wasm. So the runtime never sees that response and cannot
        // put a header on it; the static host does, and a static host that
        // says nothing gets `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE` plus a `Worker`
        // `error` event with an empty message, which is all the page can ever
        // be told.
        //
        // Which static host? `python3 -m http.server` in CI, Cloudflare's
        // asset server in production, whatever a contributor runs locally.
        // "Every host that ever serves this bundle must be configured to send
        // a header" is a rule with no enforcement point. The service worker
        // is the one thing that ships INSIDE the bundle and sits in front of
        // every same-origin request, so it is the deployment's header layer —
        // the coi-serviceworker pattern, applied to the requests this worker
        // otherwise waves through.
        //
        // Hence: a dev bundle answers the bypassed request itself, with the
        // network's own response plus the cross-origin-isolation pair. The
        // pair matches what the runtime already sends on everything it serves
        // in a dev deployment (the security-headers block's
        // `cross_origin_isolation`), so this makes the static files CONSISTENT
        // with the rest of the origin rather than special.
        //
        // `credentialless` rather than `require-corp`: a site an agent built
        // in this sandbox can still show a cross-origin image that carries no
        // `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`, which under `require-corp` it could
        // not.
        //
        // Every bypassed path, not just the toolchain's: the bypass list is
        // the APP's (`--extra-bypass-prefix`), so this worker cannot know
        // which of those prefixes an app loads a worker script from — and the
        // headers are inert on every response that is neither a document nor
        // a worker script, so widening the rule costs nothing and narrowing it
        // would be a guess.
        //
        // `/sw.js` is kept out. The browser fetches a worker's own script
        // outside any worker's `fetch` handler, so this branch should never
        // see it; if some future browser routes it here anyway, answering it
        // from inside the worker being replaced is how an update check gets a
        // stale script.
        //
        // The condition below reads `DEV_ENABLED`, the single build-time
        // constant declared at the top of this file (the same one
        // `initialize()` is passed), so the difference between a dev bundle
        // and a plain one is visible in ONE line of the shipped file rather
        // than decided at runtime — and a non-dev bundle keeps the plain
        // early return it always had. Flipping that one line is also exactly
        // what the sandbox's export rewrites to ship the shell with the
        // sandbox off (`blocks/dev/export.rs`).

/**
 * The network's answer to a bypassed request, plus the cross-origin-isolation
 * headers. See the long comment in the `fetch` listener for why this exists.
 *
 * The body is PIPED, never buffered: the assets this runs on include
 * multi-megabyte wasm parts, and reading one into an ArrayBuffer to hand it
 * back would double the peak memory of every load for no gain. `response.body`
 * is the original stream; the new `Response` wraps it.
 *
 * An opaque, opaque-redirect or error response is returned untouched. Its
 * headers are not readable and its body is not exposed, so constructing a new
 * `Response` from one does not copy it — it silently replaces it with an empty
 * 200, which is far worse than the missing header this function exists to add.
 * (Same-origin requests should never produce one here, since the cross-origin
 * check above already returned; this is the guard for the case where they do.)
