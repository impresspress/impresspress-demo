// ships the runtime shell with the sandbox turned OFF, then had to find and
// rewrite two different renderings and assert both. One line, one rewrite,
// one assertion: flipping the declaration below from true to false is the
// whole of turning a dev bundle into a plain one. (Deliberately NOT spelled

// THIS worker will never ask it for — the development sandbox refuses a site

// other versions' entries dropped at `activate`.
//
// Why it is kept and not fetched when needed: the browser keeps a worker's
// SCRIPTS (this file and the glue it imports) with the installed version,
// but not what the worker fetches at runtime — and `init()` fetches the
// binary. A deployment deletes the previous binary from the host, and a
// returning visitor's worker is usually one the browser stopped while idle.
// The visit after a deploy starts that OLD worker again to answer it, before
// the browser's update check has installed the new one; fetching its runtime
// from the host then gets a 404, the worker dies at stage `load`, and the
// boot shell's recovery starts replacing it while the browser is installing
// the update. Kept here, the old worker boots the runtime it was installed
// with, answers the visit, and is replaced by the update like any live
// worker (`sw-update.spec.ts` stops the worker before the deploy visit).
//
// One binary per version, and one version kept once a new one activates —
// a few megabytes of the origin's quota, which it shares with the app's
// local data. A version whose binary the host does not have fails to install,
// and a browser keeps the worker it has rather than switch to one that
// cannot start: the host no longer has the binary, or what it answered is
// not a WebAssembly module at all — a host that falls
// back to its app shell for unknown paths (the dev sandbox's
// `not_found_handling = "single-page-application"`) answers a deleted binary
// with a 200 and an HTML page (`keepRuntime`). A full quota does NOT fail
// the install: the version keeps nothing and loads its runtime from the
// host, as every version did before this cache.
//
// `loader.js`'s recovery drops this cache with every other one, so the
// replacement it registers fetches its runtime afresh; `runtimeBinary`
// falls back to the host for a worker whose entry has gone.

        // put a header on it; the static host does, and a static host that
        // says nothing gets `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE` plus a `Worker`
        // `error` event with an empty message, which is all the page can ever
        // be told.
        //
        // Which static host? `python3 -m http.server` in CI, Cloudflare's
        // asset server in production, whatever a contributor runs locally.
        // "Every host that ever serves this bundle must be configured to send
        // a header" is a rule with no enforcement point. The service worker
        // is the one thing that ships INSIDE the bundle and sits in front of
        // every same-origin request, so it is the deployment's header layer —
        // the coi-serviceworker pattern, applied to the requests this worker
        // otherwise waves through.
        //
        // Hence: a dev bundle answers the bypassed request itself, with the
        // network's own response plus the cross-origin-isolation pair. The
        // pair matches what the runtime already sends on everything it serves
        // in a dev deployment (the security-headers block's
        // `cross_origin_isolation`), so this makes the static files CONSISTENT
        // with the rest of the origin rather than special.
        //
        // `credentialless` rather than `require-corp`: a site an agent built
        // in this sandbox can still show a cross-origin image that carries no
        // `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`, which under `require-corp` it could
        // not.
        //
        // Every bypassed path, not just the toolchain's: the bypass list is
        // the APP's (`--extra-bypass-prefix`), so this worker cannot know
        // which of those prefixes an app loads a worker script from — and the
        // headers are inert on every response that is neither a document nor
        // a worker script, so widening the rule costs nothing and narrowing it
        // would be a guess.
        //
        // `/sw.js` is kept out. The browser fetches a worker's own script
        // outside any worker's `fetch` handler, so this branch should never
        // see it; if some future browser routes it here anyway, answering it
        // from inside the worker being replaced is how an update check gets a

 * page can read. So the worker answers it itself, in the shape the runtime
 * gives every error (`wafer_block::http_codec::error_to_http_response`:
 * `error` is the coarse code, `message` the human text, `code` the precise
 * one), with the cause in the message. A page that shows `message` — every
 * auth form does — then shows the cause.

 *
 * - `recoveryErases()` — its recovery erases the app's local data, and the
 *   message says so rather than calling it a restart. "May", because that
 *   recovery runs automatically only once per tab (after that the shell
 *   stops and asks) and only once per death (another tab may already have
 *   done it), and because the browser may have stopped this worker by then:
 *   the reload then starts a new one, which tries the runtime again and may
 *   simply work.
 * - otherwise — the shell replaces this worker with a fresh one and comes
