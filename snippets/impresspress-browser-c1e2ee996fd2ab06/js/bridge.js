 * Export the sql.js DB to a Uint8Array and write it to OPFS at

 *
 * Durability contract (`with_flush_mapped` in `database.rs`; the scope's
 * half in `src/flush_scope.rs`): outside a flush scope, the Rust side calls
 * this exactly ONCE per logical `DatabaseService` mutation
 * (`create`/`update`/`delete`/`upsert`/`exec_raw`/schema changes), not once
 * per SQL statement — a logical mutation that issues several statements
 * (e.g. a lazy column-add ALTER before the INSERT) is one flush, not N.
 * Inside a flush scope (one request), a mutation calls nothing: it records
 * that the scope owes a flush, and the scope calls this exactly ONCE when
 * its work is done, before the request's reply is returned. A scope that
 * mutated nothing calls it too, or awaits a running call, when another
 * scope's mutations are not yet exported (the epoch rule in
 * `src/flush_scope.rs`), and otherwise does not call it. Either way the
 * flush happens even when a logical operation's own result is an error,
 * since an earlier statement inside it may already have mutated the
 * in-memory sql.js DB. There is no
 * background/debounced/timer-based flush — a `DatabaseService` call made
 * outside a scope has attempted its flush by the time it returns, and a
 * scope has attempted its one flush by the time it hands its output back,
 * so the only crash-loss windows are "mid-flush" (the tab or Service
 * Worker is killed while `dbFlush` itself is exporting/writing) and, inside
 * a scope, between a mutation and the end of every scope that could report
 * it done: by the epoch rule no scope ends, and so no reply is sent, while a
 * mutation completed before its end is unexported, whichever scope made it.
 *
 * sql.js's `export()` closes the connection and opens a new one, which rolls
 * back a transaction still open on it. The Rust side ends any such
 * transaction itself before calling this (`end_open_transaction` in
 * `database.rs`), so that rollback is reported rather than silent. With
 * calls serialized (below), `export()` runs at least a microtask after the
 * call, and behind a running flush only once that flush's whole OPFS write
 * has finished, so other code runs on the connection in between. A complete
 * transaction there is still safe: the Rust side runs `BEGIN`, its
 * statements and `COMMIT` synchronously (`in_transaction` in
 * `database.rs`, no `await` in between), so no export can land inside
 * one. Only a stray `BEGIN` left open through `query_raw` across an
 * `await` could be rolled back, silently, by an export that lands in that
 * window.
 *
 * Calls are serialized: each one exports only after every earlier call has
 * finished writing (or failed). The service worker handles several requests
 * at once and each flushes at its own end, so two calls can overlap; each
 * would open its own `createWritable()` swap file, and the last `close()` to
 * land would win — an earlier export finishing after a later one would put
 * an older snapshot back on disk. Queued behind the running one, a call
 * exports when its turn comes, so the export it writes holds every mutation
 * made before the call, and its promise settles only once that export is
 * written. A failed call rejects its own caller and does not stop the next.

// matching finish or abort leaves the object unwritable until the Service
// Worker restarts. Rust's `put_streaming` aborts on every error path.

// by `storageList` and served by both read paths, which fall back to a default
// content type when the sidecar is missing. Discarding a write is routine here
