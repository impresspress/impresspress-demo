// A dead worker is replaced IN PLACE: the recovery registers the same file

// script URL as a new version; sw.js's `skipWaiting()` and `clients.claim()`
// then put it in the dead one's place in every tab at once — the same road a
// new deployment's worker takes. Nothing is ever unregistered, so there is
// no moment at which the origin has no worker and a navigation to a path only
// a worker serves would be the static host's to answer.
//
// The URL has to be new because registering the SAME script URL again is no
// update at all when the bytes have not changed: the dead instance, poisoned
// in memory, stays. (And unregistering first does not help: while any other
// tab is still controlled by the dead worker, a browser revives the
// registration with that instance in it — measured in Chromium.)
//
// Every boot that is not a recovery registers the script URL the origin's
// registration already has, so a healthy worker is not replaced for
// nothing; with no registration, WORKER_URL.
//
// A recovery is never one of two replacements at once. A deployment's update
// replaces a worker too, dead or alive, and the browser installs one version
// at a time, discarding an installing version when another is registered
// over it. So before a recovery registers anything it asks whether an update
// already owns the transition (`updateUnderway`), and leaves it to the
// update if so.
//
// One known cost of the query: a CDN that keys its cache on the query string
// and is purged of `/sw.js` only could answer `/sw.js?recovery=T` with the
// previous deployment's worker once. Its static import of the previous
// deployment's hashed glue fails — the host no longer has that file — so the
// browser cannot even evaluate it: `register()` rejects with a TypeError and
// nothing is replaced. The recovery then ends on the stopped screen with the
// cause (`recoveryFailed`), whose "Try again" registers under another new

// a link followed, an address typed, an agent's `goto` — is answered by the
// worker, which holds it until the runtime has started: the same seconds the
// shell's own probe is waiting for. Both get their answer at about the same
// moment, and a reload of the shell requested then CANCELS the navigation
// under way and puts the tab back here — on `/`, rendered by the app, in
// place of the page that was asked for. (Both live runs of 2026-10-08 opened
// `/llms.txt` that way and landed on the sandbox's welcome page.) A
// navigation under way is where the tab is going — wherever that is — so the
// shell stands down and lets it finish.
//
// Two things tell the shell a navigation has begun, one per engine:
//
// - `beforeunload`, which desktop browsers fire at a document as a
//   navigation away from it begins, whoever started it (the Navigation
//   API's `navigate` event is not fired for one started from the browser's
//   own UI). Chromium lets the probe under way finish, so this flag is how
//   it knows.
// - In WebKit the probe itself: once a navigation away from a document has
//   begun, WebKit rejects the request under way and every request the
//   document makes after it ("Load failed"; measured in Playwright's
//   WebKit). iOS Safari does not fire `beforeunload` reliably, so there
//   this is the only signal — and the shell needs no other, because it goes
//   on to the app only on the app's ANSWER (`askApp`): a probe that could
//   not be made is made again, not taken for one.
//
// There is no event for a navigation that began and then left the document
// in place (a download, a 204), so the line the shell shows when it stands
// down says what to do if the page stays.

// that ERASES must not leave the transition to a version already in place:
// that version may have loaded the data already — into memory, written back
// on its next flush — and an erase after it would be undone. A version
// still installing or waiting has loaded nothing, and the erase lock the
// button holds keeps it from loading until the erase is done.
//
// `notStarting` is a version coming in that does NOT count: the one a
// button on the not-started screen (`renderNotStartedUI`) was pressed about,
// because it has not activated. Leaving the transition to it would be one
// more wait for that same activation, which Chromium can lose for good;

// (`updateUnderway`). If another tab has meanwhile recovered from the same
// death, nothing is replaced or erased again: this tab boots onto what that
// tab left.
//
// When it erases, the erase has two runtimes to stay clear of, and each
// holds the database in memory and writes it back when it flushes:
//
// - the OLD worker, which a button may find ALIVE (slow, on the waiting
//   screen): erased under it, the data comes back the next time it writes.
//   So the erase waits until the replacement has ACTIVATED — a browser
//   activates a new version only once the old one is between events, and
//   sends it none after — which is when the old worker is done writing.
// - the REPLACEMENT, which must not load the data before it is erased. So
//   ERASE_LOCK (and RESET_LOCK, which tells other tabs a reset is under
//   way) is taken BEFORE the replacement is registered — and before
//   RECOVERY_LOCK, as RESET_LOCK explains — and held across the
//   wait for it to activate, until the erase is done; no worker loads the
//   data while the lock is held.
//
// Then the app is entered. An erase that did not complete is shown
// (`renderEraseFailedUI`) instead of the app being entered as though it
// had.
//
// "Activated" can take a while under a worker that is alive: a browser does
// not activate a new version while the old one is in the middle of an event
// (measured in Chromium — `skipWaiting()` notwithstanding). Until then
// nothing has been erased; after CONTROL_WAIT_MS the person is asked
// (`renderNotStartedUI`), and the locks are let go only if they start over.

//               another tab. Nothing is replaced or erased; the worker that
//               tab registered has taken this page too, or will when asked,
//               and this boot goes on like an ordinary one.
// - `spent`     this tab's one automatic recovery has been used and the app
//               has not answered since: show the cause and wait.
// - `updating`  an update owns the transition (`updateUnderway`): a newer
//               version is installed and on its way in, or already in.
//               Nothing is replaced or erased — the new version may well
//               start on the data the dead one could not — and the death is
//               recorded as recovered from, so other tabs join it.
//               `registration` is bringing that version in.
// - `recovered` the worker was replaced (and the data erased, where
//               `erasesFor` and `mayEraseAutomatically` allow).
//               `registration` is bringing the replacement in.
// - `unreplaced` the replacement could not be registered (`error`): the
//               stopped screen is shown, `recoveryFailed`.
