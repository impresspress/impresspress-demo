// new deployment's worker takes. Nothing is ever unregistered, so there is
// no moment at which the origin has no worker and a navigation to a path only
// a worker serves would be the static host's to answer.
//
// The URL has to be new because registering the SAME script URL again is no
// update at all when the bytes have not changed: the dead instance, poisoned
// in memory, stays. (And unregistering first does not help: while any other
// tab is still controlled by the dead worker, a browser revives the
// registration with that instance in it — measured in Chromium.)
//
// Every boot that is not a recovery registers the script URL the origin's
// registration already has, so a healthy worker is not replaced for
// nothing; with no registration, WORKER_URL.
//
// One known cost of the query: a CDN that keys its cache on the query string
// and is purged of `/sw.js` only could answer `/sw.js?recovery=T` with the
// previous deployment's worker once. That worker imports a glue file the new
